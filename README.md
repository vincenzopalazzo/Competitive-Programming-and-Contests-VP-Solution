## Introduction

Each solution is provided with a battery of test unity and a code structure under the src directory.

- src
    - test
      - *Main.cpp*: Tests units where is possible test the solution in local with the test result on console.
      - **.hpp*: A couple of file to implement the test tools, implemented inside the repository [cpstl]()
    - core
      - *SolutionName.hpp*: file that contains the solution of the problem
      - One or more data structure file implemented inside the repository [cpstl]()
    - *MainSite.cpp*: The file that contains the solution for the online judge
    - *CMakeFile*

The solution are provided with different implementation (where is present or covered from the developer) with a complete benchmark developer with [Google benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)
on a common machine with the following characteristic.
