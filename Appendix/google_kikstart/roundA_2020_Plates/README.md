## Problem
Dr. Patel has N stacks of plates. Each stack contains K plates. Each plate has a positive beauty value, describing how beautiful it looks.

Dr. Patel would like to take exactly P plates to use for dinner tonight. If he would like to take a plate in a stack, he must also take all of the plates above it in that stack as well.

Help Dr. Patel pick the P plates that would maximize the total sum of beauty values.

_What is the maximum number of houses you can buy?_

### Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing the three integers N, K and P. Then, N lines follow. 
The i-th line contains K integers, describing the beauty values of each stack of plates from top to bottom.

### Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum total sum of beauty values that Dr. Patel could pick.

### Limits
Time limit: 20 seconds per test set.

Memory limit: 1GB.

1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
1 ≤ K ≤ 30.
1 ≤ P ≤ N * K.

The beauty values are between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Test set 1
1 ≤ N ≤ 3.
Test set 2
1 ≤ N ≤ 50.
